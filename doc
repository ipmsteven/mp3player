Mplayer's FIFO


First make the FIFO for mplayer:

mkfifo ~/.mplayer/.mplayer_fifo

Now, you can control mplayer via the FIFO by specifying a file with -input:

mplayer -input file=~/.mplayer/.mplayer_fifo $mediafiles
echo "pt_step 1" > ~/.mplayer/.mplayer_fifo
echo "pause" > ~/.mplayer/.mplayer_fifo

Let’s see all the available commands that the FIFO accepts:

mplayer -input cmdlist
You can have mplayer by default open the FIFO by specifying the path to your FIFO in your ~/.mplayer/config:

> cat ~/.mplayer/config
# mplayer config file
input=file=~/.mplayer/.mplayer_fifo
And that’s all. Use mplayer’s FIFO.

MPlayer allows you bind any key/button to any MPlayer command using a simple config file. The syntax consist of a key name followed by a command. The default config file location is $HOME/.mplayer/input.conf but it can be overridden using the -input conf option (relative path are relative to $HOME/.mplayer).

Full list of supported key names by running:
mplayer -input keylist
 
Full list of available commands by running:
mplayer -input cmdlist
